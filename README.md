# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This is a collection of questions related to data structures and algorithm problems that I have worked on in Leetcode. It starts out from basic concepts like arrays, strings, etc and goes to some advanced topics like Dynamic Programming, Tries, Backtrackinng, etc. 

# How are you keeping this updated?
I am using a github workflow to sync to my leetcode account. I added my csrf tokens and leetcode session cookie in as secrets which it uses to pull information from there.
